Numerous celebrities are pairing them up with skinny jeans or tights and they just add a nice touch to any wardrobe. They are very attractive and you can't go wrong with them for casual wear.Something I must not is that your must wear thick socks with these. I tend to get blisters on my feet if I don't. I must also not that these boots will wear down your feet. After wearing them for 8 hours walking a good bit, my feet felt like they were about to fall off from the rest of my body.

We have always gotten her good shoes usually fitted at Jamiel's or other high end stores. 99% of the time, we get her shoes, sneakers or boots, she wears them 1-2x's & complains about the fit! I'd  about had it & was thinking  it would cost less to move to a tropical climate & let her run barefoot!!!! So far AMAZON has been a lifesaver ( hers anyway!)  I bought NB wide $40 sneakers & she LOVES them, wearing them consistently  3-4 times a week. Snow came & we had problems...... Uggs are her fav pair yet they aren't for snow & rain :( so the hunt was on! Cheap ones, wide, xtra wide, expensive ones, ones we'd never heard of- ALL didn't fit...then, looking thru the WIDE width section of girls shoes on here- I found THESE. Now I had tried a different brand of work boots & they fit terrible & were made even worse, so I worried. I waited days, looked again, 1left in her size 5.5 wide! I grabbed em' , I was desperate!  They came today- I was shaking, she was scared yet another wouldn't fit... Well Dear Lord she put them on & ran around the house smiling & yelling &#34;I LOVE EM' &#34;!!  She has a EE width, yet these in just wide fit perfect! I am now looking to buy stock in the company , as I will be buying soooo many pairs in various sizes! THANK YOU Timberland & Amazon!  Made well, soft leather & the sole is flexible. A great boot-\",\n",

I received these in yesterday, and will update the review if they don't break in well or last. So far my impressions are - 1. Accurate to size, 13w, I wear New Balance / Nike wide tennis shoes as additional reference 2. Comfortable, but not cushiony if you know what I mean, I wore them all day yesterday without blisters or sore spots 3. I was expecting non insulated boots, which I got, but these are still warm to hot - gussetted tongue and no ventilation means these are not a boot I am looking forward to wearing on a construction site in the middle of a Texas summer. I have received in what I expected, and given Timberlands reputation and my exp I'm giving it 5 stars pending further experience with this pair of boots.\",\n",

It got to be a joke at work because people could hear me coming several offices away.I called Timberland and stated my problem with the shoes and they gave me an RMA number to return the shoes and requested a letter stating the problem.  I wrote the letter including all contact information and sent the boots back to Timberland insured and return receipt requested at a cost of $15.Thanksgiving goes by, then Christmas, then New Years with no word about my shoes.  Finally after New Years I called and gave them the RMA number and they stated they would replace the shoes.  A week later I received a new pair of shoes from Timberland.

If you stand in puddles or are in driving rain for long period of time, expect your feet to get a little wet possibly.  Also, they're not as warm in lower temperatures.  I suggest going up a size or so and adding a double-thick insole to help keep feet warmer in colder weather, as described in my original reveiw below.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I like them because they're waterproof and help keep my baby's feet warm.I don't know why my baby likes them, but doesn't like to take them off, wears them as long as possible and whenever possible.i did change out the laces because they kept coming undone, even with a double knot according to the daycare center but I find this to be the case with most boot laces.  I took a pair of long, flat pink laces out of an old pair of boots until I can find lavender laces to match online.  They actually look very nice in contrast with the dusty lavender boot.The boots are study and of the quality I've come to expect from Timberland.  My thanks to Amazon, I got these pre-season for $19.33.  EXCELLENT PURCHASE.I won't have to worry during rain or cold, snowy days.  I bought these 1&1/2 sizes too big and put in extra-thick insoles and they are worn with extra-thick, wool blend, padded socks.  As my child grows, I can remove the insoles or buy the regular thick size.  I just get the dr, scholls or store brand and cut them down to size for my baby, who has these in a 9.5 medium for toddlers.  Actual foot size is about an 8 1/4.  They don't fall off and baby appears to be comfortable; can run, jump and play in these with no issues.  I see no foot blisters so I am happy.\",\n",

Good traction and makes for sure-footing outside, on hikes and the like. I didn't think it would be the best winter boot but there have been no complaints on cold snowy days regarding warmth. Obviously more time consuming to tie up than other boots so sometimes little ones don't want to take that time. A big difference from off brands is that the exterior holds up great, is of high quality and doesn't appear to &#34;scratch off&#34;. Very happy and will buy the next larger size next year.

I was concerned they'd be too stiff, but ordered them anyway based on other reviews and because they're offered in wide sizes (not common for toddler boots-trust me I've looked ALL OVER). By the time Ifound them, the only color available in their sizes was black, which has actually worked out well.  My boys LOVE these and don't want to wear anything else, so next fall, assuming they'll have outgrown these, this is all I'm buying.  In addition to all the wonderful qualities everyone else has cited, I am so grateful they make the toddler boots in wide sizes too.  One boy is actually an extra wide, so I ordered a half size up-the fit is great, and more to the point, he must be comfortable because he demands I put them on.\",\n",

They'll start our order as soon as you want to exchange it and before you even send it back to them. This is great for anxious shoppers!!

I have to say the Merrells look more comfortable as they're not as stiff, have a padded tongue, and fuller padding around the ankle.  That all being said, the 5 year old loves these... because they're pink.  The laces are difficult to tie as they are so slippery and tend to loosen up before you can get a good bow tied, especially for a young one just learning to tie.  They are competent boots, which were hard to find for little girls.  We used them on short hikes in a state park and they performed acceptably.  Cannot comment on their waterproofness as we did not tromp through any water.  If you have a little princess with her heart set on pink and a need for waffle-stompers, these will work.\",\n",

Snug if I wear thickish sports socks which is how I like it since they style is to wear them loosely laced.I've used these for a week and a half now and your feet may take some getting used to the boots, as they tend to be fairly heavy.

The tongue cut into the top of my ankle; I'm not sure if this is because it was cut too long, or if it was because the leather is too rough.  In order to walk around with the shoes on, I had to unlace the top two holes and bend the tongue back.  The bottom of this shoe is clunky.  The inside sole was hard and not giving as well as loose; maybe an easy fix, I don't know.  They are not comfortable.\",\n",

But now that the cooler weather is coming- I'll also wear them to walk the dog. It's a nice change from my Avia toning sneaks. Don't get me wrong-My Avia's I've ordered 3x-been wearing them for years. But like I said- I'm ready for a switch now in clothing and foot wear. And these boots are not only quality. But they are comfortable and stylish. I gave these 4 stars-because I'm as picky as they come. I thought the laces could be a little thicker-and just a tad longer. Regardless-I'd order these again.\",\n",

I have the black, smooth full grain leather version.The leather is reasonably thick but not so stiff as to be unbearable, yet you're definitely going to want to wear these a while to break them in before you go out in the field with them all day.The first catch is the length is fairly true to size but the D width I ordered and received is not, rather it is clearly wider than a D should be, at least an E width but that's not all bad since being uninsulated, you may want heavy socks on in winter.The second catch is the tongue on these is stitched in so high up (to offer deeper water resistance) that it's a strain to get it open wide enough to slide my feet in, even without laces in them!  I took a knife and slit it down an extra inch so they slip on with about the same force as other boots I've owned.Third catch is poor strings.  They're round, look fine at first but the outer jacket separates and creates a little hernia looking bulge where the white inner stuffing pokes out.  Once it got bad enough I took some black sewing thread and stitched around as each new area opened up.  Next time I get new boots that do this I'll just buy new strings instead.I love the tread on these.  It has some bite but not all those tiny cracks and crevices that some boots have which makes them MUCH MUCH easier to clear soil and snow out of.  It's more of a field tread than an urban tread but you don't feel like you're wearing cleats on a hard floor either.  If you're old school you will appreciate the long wearing high density rubber sole, although it is not as high density as what I remember from years ago, it does have some give to it, perhaps more silicone in the compound (I don't know, am not a rubber chemist).Overall I'm left feeling like these are not worth their cost.  Besides the strings I do expect to get good wear out of them but $100 boots should have correct width sizing, you should be able to slide your feet in without altering them,  and they should have premium laces not junky ones.They still get 3 stars for the decent leather and durable, easy to clean tread but once they wear out I'll be replacing them with something else instead.  Then again, I may change my mind by then as they're nowhere near worn out yet.\",\n",

They were cushioned and comfortable from the moment I tried them on in the store, and they held up to heavy use.  I wore them for ten or twelve years, through college and graduate school as a field biologist and outdoor enthusiast.  I spent a few of those years in Oregon, where I wore these almost every day during the nine month rainy season.  (I use clear wax on the leather uppers periodically to keep them waterproof and to hide the scuffs).  By the time I needed a new pair, the Internet existed and I was able to find and order a replacement.  I have been wearing that second pair for at least another twelve years, and they are ready to be retired (there is no traction left on the soles, and one sole has finally come loose from the boot).  I can't express how happy I am to find this model available here.  My actual size is 9.5W, but I wear moderately thick socks with hiking boots, and I have found that the 10M in this model is perfect for me.  (If you are looking for hiking socks, by the way, try a pair of Thorlos!)\",\n",

Then on my trip I walked 3-5 miles daily for a week.  I had ZERO break-in problems with them, they were comfortable right out of the box.  I can also attest to their excellent waterproofing as I accidentally had to walk through a 3-inch deep puddle and although my pants around my shoes were soaked, not one drop got into my shoes and my feet stayed warm and dry.  I'm very pleased with these shoes and looking forward to continuing to wear them on all my trips this summer.\",\n",

After I found this style of Timberland hiking boots 20 years ago, I never looked at another brand/style of hiking boot.

I also use  Dr Schols insoles. The insoles that the boots come with are not the best or worst. I just need more cousin plus I have a wide foot. My foot is 4 and half inches wide at the largest part. M size was perfect for me. Remember the leather will stretch and relax. I bought my first pair for work in a locksmith shop and moving safes. They help up very well with daily use over a year plus riding a motorcycle and being in the weather. I changed jobs to installing industrial floors and the boots really took a beating. The leather stretched even more and I needed to put 2 pair of insoles in to keep the fit right. The toes a wore through to the composite shell and soles rounded on the sides. Still these boots are great for working in 2 years later. I liked the way they looked when they were a little ruffed up so much I purchased another pair for casual time.

I LOVE these boots and have been wearing them every day for almost 3 years, 12 hours a day, on ice, snow and volcanic rock/ash (extremely abrasive) in sub zero temps.  Mine are showing signs of wear but are still 100% functional and I should get at least another 6-8 months out of them.  They've been treated maybe 3 times with Sno Seal, but that's it as far as pampering.  They have performed way better than I expected for the price, plus they look good and feel good, and pull on & off with ease.  In the past I have paid twice as much as what these cost for safety boots that I couldn't wait to get off my feet at the end of the day.  I am mostly ordering replacements before mine are total goners so that I always have a back up, because I know there is no way I will ever find a more comfortable work boot. I hope Timberland never discontinues the Wellington! I normally wear a women's size 8.5-9 and the men's size 7 fits perfectly with my Darn Tough merino wool socks inside.  For happy feet, don't hesitate...these are worth every penny.\",\n",

I have large wide feet (13 Wide) and it's difficult to find shoes for me that I like.However, they have 2 problems:1.) Made in China, as most things are these days.2.) The rubber started separating from one shoe after one week of wear. Not a big problem for me since I always has epoxy around home. I simply glued it back together with epoxy and a couple of clamps.Update April 1, 2013:Now I have been wearing these shoes for nearly a month. They are extremely comfortable walking shoes. They have good traction in snow and on most surfaces. Nor do they seem to slip much on ice.The only problem was mention above where the rubber sole on one shoe started to come apart. I fixed it with a liberal amount of boat building type epoxy, which has held. No problems with the opposite shoe, and no other problems since.I am a heavy person with large wide feet. These shoes are among the most comfortable shoes that I have had in recent years. The steel toe is extra security for my feet.Update September 4, 2013I wear these shoes every day. They are the most comfortable work or walking shoe that I own.I just upgraded them to 4 stars because of that.But they are definitely not a 5 star shoe because of their quality control. As I mentioned before, one of the shoes had the sole come loose shortly after I purchased it. I glued that shoe back together again with a good quality epoxy. No problems since then, and I like these shoes.\",\n",

Also, you will probably be wearing thicker socks in them at some point (winter maybe), so the additional space of at least a half size would be a must.

I have worn them in many types of conditions(despite them being vented on the sides) and they can take what you dish out.  They do lack somewhat in that they are vented down the sides so they certainly aren't waterproof.  Unfortunately, this feature makes it more of a seasonal boot that is not conducive to wading through snow, wet grass, or getting extremely wet.  As a previous reviewer pointed out, the fact that this boot is so supportive, does not make it a quick on-off.  The pros ,however, (comfort and major support) far outweigh the cons if you have foot problems such as chronic heel pain or plantar fasciitis.  I just need for Timberland to make an insulated, waterproof version of this boot and I'll be set.In summary:Pros: extremely supportive, very comfortable, excellent traction, highly durableCons: Not waterproof, Not quick to take on and off\",\n",

The rubbing has subsided.  I walk well over 4 miles a day carrying 70+ pounds of gear.  The boots are comfortable and stable while walking up, down and along hills.  I thought I would have problems with rocks collecting in the tread, I was wrong.  They do collect mud easily, but a quick kick dislodges most if not all of the mud.  These boots are not water proof, so keep that in mind when purchasing.  I live in Arizona, so water and rain are not much of an issue here.  Heat is an issue here and these boots keep my feet cool.  I am really pleased with my purchase.  One last note.  When I was looking for boots I went to Sears and they didn't have what I was looking for, I left went out to my truck and purchased these in the parking lot at 16:45 Friday on my phone.  They arrived at 08:00 Saturday.  I paid the extra money for shipping and was really happy I made that choice too.\",\n",

The size 9 are still a little more narrow than my original 8.5 from 18 months ago. So obviously Timberline had these run on a different factory in China. FIT IS RUNNING WAY SMALLER on this second pair I now have. I actually put the soles together , bottom to bottom from old pair and new pair. it was VERY OBVIOUS my new pair are much smaller.

I have never had good luck with shoes wearing in to become comfortable when starting out with them this tight. I literally thought I would be running home mid-day to change my shoes but tried it anyway. It worked. They felt tight most of the morning but gradually loosened up. I wear them everday(about a month now) and don't even have to think about the fit. They have great traction and ventilation so no complaints about that. The only issue is the lace eyes.(zoom in if you can) Notice that they resemble webbing material. Since the strings are kind of short that come with the shoes they easily come out of the eye and are tedious to get re-laced. Yeah, yeah I can buy longer laces but regardless, i've already decided that these shoes have a poor design for lacing eyes and I suspect that next issue will be either the eyes will cut the laces or the laces will be cutting the eyes. Granted this is still speculation, but I still expect this will be a problem.  However it shakes out if I manage to get a year out of these I'd say they were worth the money. Normally I buy either Redwings or Wolverines which are generally twice the cost but the look and the price got me to try these out this time. If they start falling apart on me in less than a year it'll be back to the tried and true.\",\n",

I am an \"Entertainment Electrician\" - I work with the lighting & rigging for exhibits, trade shows, conventions, concerts, etc...  So I naturally find myself working outdoors as well as indoors.  I also have to be able to work on a ladder, in a lift, or out on ceiling beams / catwalks and the like.  Depending on the project, the hours we work can be grueling - 16+ hr days, several days straight.  So finding the right pair of work boots that are comfortable, lightweight, waterproof, and protect from electrical shock hazard are difficult.  As mentioned in a previous review, there are 3 styles/colors.  Of those three only the \"Brown\" color is waterproof.  You can see (zooming into the photo images) on the boot exterior midway up the ankle there is a \"waterproof membrane\" label embedded in the skin.  I have flat feet so for every pair of shoes/boots I have an arch support insert I use.  Even still, these boots are very comfortable.  They offer excellent traction.  I have worn them while trudging thru snow & ice...my feet stay warm and dry.  I have walked thru puddles as deep as my foot.  So long as the water does not go over your ankle and into the neoprene boot insert, your feet will stay dry.  They provide excellent traction.  They do offer a tight fit.  Even over several months they stay tight. Personally, I like that.  I feel it is because they are waterproof.  The only wish I have is that I could get them in all black...stealth military style.  That would work well for when I am working backstage.',\n",

Just kind of a neoprene piece with a rolled edge.  This causes them to put a bit too much pressure on your achilles tendon, which tends to be irritating and uncomfortable.  Other than that, and a bit of an occasional squeak when walking, they are a decent, comfortable shoe so far.  I have been buying the Timberland PRO Gorge shoes for a few years, and I really like those.  The fit is very similar, but those are Electro-Static Dissapative, and this time I was looking for something with Electrical Hazard Protection.

I am a professional photographer and I was looking for a steel-toe boot to wear while photographing field sports (primarily American football and soccer).I get on my knees a lot when I shoot and before wearing these my toes would cramp up by the end of a game. I wanted a boot that was firm and rigid to reduce the bend on my toes when kneeling, but I also didn\\'t want them to weight too much because I often run up and down the field to get in position to photograph the next play ...these are perfect for that!The other thing I liked about these is the tongue is sealed all the way up to the last two laces so dirt and rocks don\\'t get down inside the boot. I use to come home with my shoes filled with black rubber bits (used on turf fields), but not anymore!The Timberland PRO \"24/7 Comfort Suspension\" comfort system makes these boots the most comfortable I\\'ve ever worn, plus the traction on any surface is outstanding! The heat-resistant sole is excellent when shooting on hot days (especially on hot fields). I shot five games back to back (over a 12-hour period) in 110 degree heat at a 6-man football tournament last August ...my feet didn\\'t sweat at all and while the rest of my body ached, my feet felt fine at the end of that long hot day.So far the only negative thing I can say is after 3 months there was some thread coming loose on the material in the breathing areas on the side of the boots. I just cut it off and haven\\'t had any problems since. I\\'m pretty hard on my boots and they still look great 4 months later. Heck, they look good enough to wear to church on Sunday after 4 months of wear ;)The only thing missing is waterproofing ...my next pair of Timberland\\'s will be waterproof!',\n",

The boots I have been using, which were Hytest, are just not as comfortable as these, I had to buy an insert to provide more cushioning for the Hytest boots. My feet stared to hurt after a few months of wear, so when I was finally able to get knew boots and found out how much my part would be, I started looking online and found my old favorites at an excellent price. Can't wait to start using these again and get some foot support. Thank you Amazon for getting them to me in just a few days!\",\n",

The cloth body literally tore apart due to the many sewn panels that make up the shoe.  The threads on the one shoe of the cloth hiker were nicked once on a broken pallet and quickly disintegrated.  The sidewall near the sole on the other shoe blew out.  I haven't had any of those kinds of problems with the Ratchet.  The rubberized toe covering over the steel-toe on the Ratchet is still intact and has saved my feet from pallets, etc. being dropped on them numerous times.  The leather body has withstood scrapes and punctures.  Most importantly, the shoe is still comfortable without needing Doctor Scholl's inserts. I went through inserts about every 2-3 months with the Timberland Pro cloth hikers which cost about $15 a pop.  The Ratchet Hiker's still wearing well and still looking good.

They certainly didn't seem bad while I was wearing them, and although of course my feet get hot when I'm walking hard all day, it's easily bearable.The only downside I can think of is that the front of my foot is very wide and even with the generous toe box there can be some slight chafing, so socks with good padding are recommended.I have not yet had much chance to test their waterproof qualities, but I have no doubt they'll do just fine through the winter. All in all, they feel solid but comfortable, and I have no qualms about wearing them 24/7 in whatever conditions I encounter.

I bought the Timberlands to change the Bostonian ones and I am disapointed. I am affraid to send them back and get the same quality pair back.In few words, the design is nice, they are confortable but the quality is not reliable. Be prepare to send them back.',\n",

I would say these boots did a great job keeping his feet clean and dry. The material is waterproof which is great for a brave toddler who likes going through all forms of water. The only time his feet got wet while wearing these was when his foot was submerged, so naturally the water came in through the top.These boots are attractive and my son absolutely loves them and loves to show them off. They fit perfectly. Not too big nor too small. I was very relieved to see that they come in half sizes as my son is just a little too big for the 7, but not quite ready for the 8.They are easy to clean off once walked through several trails of mud. DO NOT PUT THEM IN THE DRYER. This will ruin the nice exterior material and these great boots will no longer be waterproof.Overall, I would recommend these for any adventurous little one who has a hard time avoiding puddles and other feet-drenching material!',\n",

The bootstrings where first to go (they got shredded up, but it is to be expected), and wore one pair to the point of removing most of its sole.These boots are VERY comfortable, soft, and decently breathable for waterproof boots. My feet never got wet wearing these. In terms of all things I could use to rate a boot, I liked them...except for the stiching.the stitching on BOTH pairs of my boots gave out, right along the gore-tex outer layer (the area that was not made out of leather), and came undone on both sides of each boot. It was almost unbelievable...... who ever heard of a something like that?that's something you expect from Walmart boots.I fixed the problem with shoe gloop, but still, for the price of these boots you shouldn't have to make a sacrifice like that. This was all under city-conditions, and should never had fallen apart like they did. I would never, ever trust these things on a trail or serious conditions. It would see that as being a unnecessary risk.So in short, its actually a pretty decent city boot and lasted me a while, but I suggest picking up some extra boot-strings. shoe glue, and buying them on heavy discount....because you need to know what your getting out of these things.\",\n",

Also, a month before I wore them on a more strenuous hike, Mt Lafayette along the Franconia Ridge Walk in the White Mountain Forest - a 9 mile, 11 hour (for me), 3,900 foot climb to an elevation of 5,300 feet - the best hike with the best views ever, boot hikes strongly recommended if in the area. Anyway, these boots, along with hiking socks, kept my feet comfortable with zero complaints.The Timberline Chicorua boots are sturdy, comfortable and waterproof. I had owned a pair of the slightly less expense Timberland White Ledge boots for over 4 years which have identical bottom and I loved them. For my replacement boots I decided to move up to the next model in the line, the Chicorua, because of the slightly taller support around the ankle and the Gore-Tex membrane which makes them more breathable. My first test was a 4 mile mountain hike over rocky terrain and they felt great without any previous break-in period. I have now used them for backcountry hiking up rough terrain in the White Mountains and Acadia National Park on a 10 day trip and my feet never felt better during or after the hike - no complaints at all, these are the best boots I ever owned!!!Tip 1: As soon as you get these boots rub the leather with some mink oil and repeat a few times year. This will keep them waterproof and insure the leather doesn't dry or crack and will extend their useful life. I did this with my last pair of Timberlines and the leather still looks great after over 4 years.Tip 2: For serious hikes do not use cheap cotton socks. Instead either use wool socks in winter or Hiking Socks. Hiking socks, like Thorlo are expensive but well worth it because they not only wick away moisture, which cotton does not, but also provides much better cushioning that reduce shear and impact forces so your feet feel great and minimizes the potential for blisters. The weak link of a good boot is the socks - it took me years to realize this.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': \"I bought this pair of boots for my boyfriend for Christmas last year and instead of wearing them just for hiking he wears them for everything he does.  He wears them for every day use, for working outside, while working on the cars, and even to his daily job.  He finds them very comfortable and sturdy.  He has worn them so much that he is thinking about buying another pair.  Not because they are breaking down, but to have one pair for kicking around and one pair as a nice pair.  He also bought me this boot in a woman's size for Christmas last year and it has served me great for all my adventures and hiking abroad.  It held up great for trekking in Costa Rica and Nepal.  My feet were comfortable and stayed warm after 8 hours hikes up and down rugged terrain and in cold temperatures.  I wore the appropriate hiking socks with them (med padded merino wool socks) and never got a blister. I would buy these boots again as well.\",\n",

The first time I put on the boots they felt broken in, I wore them all day, and did not take any time to break in.  However I don't wear these boots that often.  Usually just for rainy days, and in Southern California, that is not very often.  After I would say 5-10 days of wearing the boots, the inside fabric on the boot by my arch has started to fray.  And not on just one side, but both sides.  So it is not an instance where maybe I caught one boot on a nail.  The other thing is the eyelets on the boots are starting to fray the laces.  I'm not pulling a MacGuyver and using these laces to shimmy down a zip line either, I am lacing up my boots and It is only a matter of time before the laces snap.I will probably send back to Timberland to swap them out, from reading some other reviews it does not sound like an isolated incident.\",\n",

I can get better quality cheaper.On the upside, the boots are comfortable...until it rains or snows. Wet feet are NOT comfortable at all, and once the stitching splits, they are no longer waterproof. Haven't had any issues with traction, but as I got them in the spring and they had begun to fall apart by the summer, I have limited experience with them on snow or ice.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': \"Many years ago I had this same pair of boots that lasted me for a very long time, and when they finally started falling apart I didn't hesitate to order a new pair. Well I don't remember where the first pair I owned were made, but I'm certain now it wasn't China like the new ones seem to be. On the plus side, they still fit really well and are extremely comfortable (I need boots that are a bit larger than standard) but they fall apart like wet tissue paper now.The first pair I bought was in July of 2012. Within only 1 day of normal use the inner cloth lining of the boots started separating from the outer shell! After that started to happen, it made the boots feel very strange when you walked around, kinda tight now that the liner was pushing up against your foot. I don't know if this is just a problem with the larger pairs (I use a size 12) or what, but it's definitely not acceptable, especially after only 1 day of regular walking. Needless to say, I returned them a few days later and just thought I had a defective pair.After I returned them I ordered a pair of Timberland's White Ledge boots instead, which fit very nice just like the Chocoruas, but fell apart after only 6 months or so. So here we are in July of 2013 and I tried yet again to get these boots, as I really used to like them, hoping that they would have fixed their manufacturing issues. Nope. Same exact problems the ones I had bought previously, with the inner liner separating the very first day of use.I give up. I won't ever buy a pair of Timberlands again as they don't seem to care about quality control anymore.\",\n",

I don't know if the pair that I got is defective or if they're all like that but the sock liner was not glued to the roof of the boot in the toes.  It hung loose in both boots and was very uncomfortable.  And I think greatly contributed to the boots being very hot.  Now after I've worn them several times & my feet have soaked themselves in sweat the liner has all bunched up and dried.If Timberland won't replace them then these $90 boots are going in the trash & I won't ever buy Timberland products again.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': 'These boots have held up for me better than any I\\'ve owned yet. I\\'m not inclined to spend a fortune on shoes/boots, because I tend to destroy footwear quickly. My average is 3-6 months per pair. Sketchers used to last me about 9 months, which I thought was terrific. These timberlands have lasted over a year, and I\\'m tickled. Just slightly more than a year, really, because they\\'re quite dead, now. But, for the mileage I put on them, and the pounding they took, I got my money\\'s worth.The metal lace guides, which others have had issues with, have held up for me. I was surprised by that, as I didn\\'t like them at first; the \"speed lacing\" hooks at the top particularly. I figured the laces would slide off too easily, or they\\'d bend/break in short order. Those have held well, and no trace of pulling out.However the rubberized bit was the first to separate, shortly after the one year mark. Right at the sides of the ball of the foot. Where the shoe should bend, not surprsingly, is where it started to separate. Since I find myself in standing water a bit more often than most, that hastened the end of their useful life.I still use these for yard work, when traction is not important (only about 1/16 of inch of tread left...won\\'t pass inspection!), when it\\'s dry. The rubber has completely separated from the toe on both shoes around the toe, so they\\'re water scoops, rather than water proof. Again, I don\\'t fault the boots overly much. I\\'m very, very hard on shoes and boots.Another benefit is the easily removed insoles; I use slide in orthotic insoles, and being able to easily swap \\'em out, wihtout destroying the insoles, is nice.Recommend for anyone needing comfortable, light-ish, waterproof boots not requiring steel toes, or other specific OSHA/safety features. For the money,...hard to beat.',\n",

I've always found that buying hiking boots was a risky proposition.  You never know how you're going to like them until after you've put some miles on a pair.  These boots have met all my hopes and expectations.  The only thing that I'm not thrilled about is the last two sets of eyelets at the top of the boot.  They are open hooks as opposed to closed loops or eyelets.  I find that the lace keeps popping out of the hook when I'm trying to tie it.  It's probably just my personal quirk and I suspect most hiking boots have these open hooks.  There must be some perceived advantage to these, but I would have preferred something closed.\",\n",

I replaced the hard foam insole with one from Walmart (in the shoe department) - about $9.00. Makes a big difference in comfort. I walk 10-15 miles a day and have had no problems with these boots. Very supportive to the ankles and good fit. I also walk in snow quite often and they have maintained their water proofness so far. My last pair of Timberlands were White Ledge which I have pretty much worn out in the past year. As the heels wear down, I build them back up with Shoe Goo, which gives me many more miles. The only bad thing I can say about the Chocoruas is that I can see that the laces (which are substantial) will soon be frayed due to the metal eyelets (which have a fairly sharp edge). These are well built boots and very comfortable - glad I upgraded from the White Ledge.',\n",

I loved them for the time I could wear them. However, that was only for four days. Seems in order to save some money (on a 120 dollar shoe this amazed me) Timberland decided to use bent metal eyelets for the shoe strings on the lower half of the shoe rather than a more durable cast eyelets or simple punched eyelets. Note I'm not talking about the hooks on the upper half but the lower portion. After wearing them for four days the eyelet broke at one of the bends. This type of quality fits well for the 50$ or under crowd but the 100$ or higher I just couldn't believe it. Also, note this was the second pair not the first, as the first one came with the eyelet already broken. They were so comfortable that I gave them a second chance. Unless Timberland replaces my eyelets with cast ones I'll be returning these and won't be giving them a third chance. These boots are for those trendy types who want to look like the outdoors type at the clubs but are not for the outdoors. Stay away from these boots as your hiking could be ruined if the eyelets fail at a bad time.Side note I've been wearing Timberland workbooks for the past 6 months with punched eyelets and have had no problems.\",\n",

The Trail is rated as strenuous, which is no joke, very steep incline that goes on forever. Coming back is very steep downhill to where you feel like you toes will run out the end of your boots. These Timberland boots held up extremely well. This hike was a true test of the durability of these shoes. I cannot say anything about how waterproof they are, as this area is very dry. These boots are very comfortable as long as you get the proper size. I recommend these boot, for the comfort - definitely a 10 and durability. Of course I have only had these boots out for one very strenuous hike but I was impressed at how comfortable they are and they breath very well. Even though the temperature was around 101 degrees, my feet did not get all sweaty and uncomfortable. The boots took a beating and when I got back I cleaned them up to see how well they faired and they still look great.',\n",

The quality of the materials and build are what you'd expect for Timberlands. GorTex provides water repellency and the mesh sides allow the boot to breathe okay. Probably not ideal for hot weather environments as they are a bit insulated. The leather is of great quality and the limited stitching is reinforced. The sole is great for around town use, and right at home on the trail. For ideal fit, I think I'll add a set if gel inserts, though a this I sick would suffice. I simply want to maximize the support and cut down on shock as their intended purpose are uneven trail and beach hiking.If your looking for a great fit, great quality, and an affordable multi-season boot; look no further.\",\n",

I almost feel asleep with them on and barely noticed as I was dozing off they were still on.I've yet to use them in inclement weather as I have so many other light and medium duty hiking boots, but just from how they feel and how they are constructed, I doubt they'll do badly. They vent well so my feet stay dry, and they look great. Tread grip is typical for the type, especially being so new.The one concern I was wary of were the two top lace metal grooves above ankle height. I've had boots that had similar lace grooves, and they were made of thin gauge stamped metal most of the time, and they would end up breaking off after a few months of wear due to metal fatigue and stress. The lace grooves on this boot are of a somewhat heavier gauge and they aren't stamped either.

My employer requires us to wear black shoes/boots as part of our uniform since we are out in the public.  These were the most comfortable boots I have ever worn even the first time I put them on.  The issues I have are 1.) shoelaces.  The laces that came with the boots broke within the first week that I have them.  I replaced these laces with a set I got from a pair of Columbia boots I threw out ten years ago.  Those laces have been used in six pairs of boots now, maybe Timberland and all other boot manufacturers should put more regard in the laces than they do. Laces are a very important factor to me when buying boots.  If they skimp on laces, what else do thbey skimp on 2.) Durability.  I bough these in October 2010.  I have worn them every work day since.  Both boots have developed tears where the cloth and leather are stitched together.  Unfortunately I suffer from diabetic neuropathy so I can no longer wear the boots in this condition.  I would like to see Timberland create a boot with the durability to match it's superior comfort.

Started wearing them on an appalachian trail hike in 2002 and have never bought another boot since.  I wear a 10 1/2 wide and no boot feels better with less break-in time.  The gore-tex is solid - 500 miles in winter snow (with gators) attests to that.  Obviously a short boot can\\'t keep your feet dry in high water or anything but I prefer to sacrifice height to lighter weight.I now use them exclusively on construction sites as I\\'m a full time contractor these days.  They are not construction boots, but still hold up better than anything else that\\'s comfortable.  My only Issue with them is the little metal tabs at the top like to catch either your laces or on ladders and trip you up.  Also, they will let a nail through the sole quicker than kiss my hand, but they\\'re really not made for that kind of work.  My solution for years has been to crimp those tabs closed as soon as they come out of the box since I\\'ve never used them to lace the boots anyway...and to avoid nails.Conclusion: If you\\'re looking for a light hiker: this is it.  Also check out Bone Dry Red Heads from Bass Pro as I got 1300 (literally) miles out of a pair of those (they\\'re not as comfortable, though).  If you\\'re looking for a construction boot, this is an incredibly comfortable, less protective option.Notes:  I\\'ve been through so many because construction that includes contact with concrete, gypsum, mud and other things that harden will wear out any leather boot faster than just walking and water.  They last easily as long as anything else I\\'ve had on the jobsite.Random note: I\\'ve run into maybe five or six people now randomly who will be wearing these.  One of us will throw out a \"nice boots\" and that will start us both talking about how great they are and how this their second or third pair.  Odd.',\n",

For my 3rd pair I figured I\\'d try yet another kind. I have had these Timberland Chocorua Gore-Tex Hikers now for 2 years and they have seen 4 or 5 pairs of laces and 2 pair of insoles. The boots are still comfortable, waterproof and presentable... but the soles have gone bald like an old tire with 100,000 miles on it.They aren\\'t ripped or \"blown out\" (where the side of your foot starts sticking out the side) Most importantly, they didn\\'t develop a squeak in the heels while walking. As a night security guard it\\'s not too handy to try to be stealthy while you walk around sounding like that one shopping cart at the grocery store with the bum wheel.Wrote this review while picking out a new pair, though the old pair are not getting tossed. They still make good yard boots. I may even buy 2 more pair to have one on reserve should they become unavailable at some point. Yeah, I think that highly of them.UPDATE** I just bought my new pair, in \"Noir\" because of the unavailability of the black and the price...but here\\'s the thing, despite the slight shade difference in the pictures between the \"noir\" and \"black\", they are as black as the first pair I bought. I have no idea what this description of \"noir\" is supposed to mean but suffice it to say, they are black through and through. They don\\'t get any blacker.',\n",

A quick Internet search revealed a number of users complaining about broken eyelets, and a visit to the local Timberland store provided the confirmation that \"a few\" people were having this problem. With a 10-day upcoming trip to the desert, I was justifiably concerned: A broken eyelet in the middle of nowhere would prevent proper lacing, ruining the hike.After 10 days walking over coarse and fine sand, climbing rocks, crossing streams and even using it to re-position a stubborn log in a bonfire, I couldn\\'t be happier. The Chocorua is lightweight and performed well over all kinds of terrain. On top of that, it is one of the cheapest Gore-Tex light hiking boots available on the market.== Update Feb/2013 ==I\\'ve been using these boots for 2 1/2 years now. It has been through everything from the sands and rocks of the Mojave desert, to all kinds of hikes and *daily* urban use. The Chocorua never failed me during this time. The sole started to show signs of wear after one year of use, and severe wear after two years. Please, again, note that I\\'m using these boots DAILY and most of my other shoes don\\'t last that long under the same conditions. These boots are so comfortable that I literally stopped using all my other shoes.I couldn\\'t be happier and I just ordered another pair.',\n",

If you stand in puddles or are in driving rain for long period of time, expect your feet to get a little wet possibly.  Also, they're not as warm in lower temperatures.  I suggest going up a size or so and adding a double-thick insole to help keep feet warmer in colder weather, as described in my original reveiw below.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I like them because they're waterproof and help keep my baby's feet warm.I don't know why my baby likes them, but doesn't like to take them off, wears them as long as possible and whenever possible.i did change out the laces because they kept coming undone, even with a double knot according to the daycare center but I find this to be the case with most boot laces.  I took a pair of long, flat pink laces out of an old pair of boots until I can find lavender laces to match online.  They actually look very nice in contrast with the dusty lavender boot.The boots are study and of the quality I've come to expect from Timberland.  My thanks to Amazon, I got these pre-season for $19.33.  EXCELLENT PURCHASE.I won't have to worry during rain or cold, snowy days.  I bought these 1&1/2 sizes too big and put in extra-thick insoles and they are worn with extra-thick, wool blend, padded socks.  As my child grows, I can remove the insoles or buy the regular thick size.  I just get the dr, scholls or store brand and cut them down to size for my baby, who has these in a 9.5 medium for toddlers.  Actual foot size is about an 8 1/4.  They don't fall off and baby appears to be comfortable; can run, jump and play in these with no issues.  I see no foot blisters so I am happy.\",\n",

That all being said, the 5 year old loves these... because they're pink.  The laces are difficult to tie as they are so slippery and tend to loosen up before you can get a good bow tied, especially for a young one just learning to tie.  They are competent boots, which were hard to find for little girls.  We used them on short hikes in a state park and they performed acceptably.  Cannot comment on their waterproofness as we did not tromp through any water.  If you have a little princess with her heart set on pink and a need for waffle-stompers, these will work.\",\n",

              " 531: \"Timberland Basic Boots have &#34;some&#34; of the quality you expect from Timberland.  I have the black, smooth full grain leather version.The leather is reasonably thick but not so stiff as to be unbearable, yet you're definitely going to want to wear these a while to break them in before you go out in the field with them all day.The first catch is the length is fairly true to size but the D width I ordered and received is not, rather it is clearly wider than a D should be, at least an E width but that's not all bad since being uninsulated, you may want heavy socks on in winter.The second catch is the tongue on these is stitched in so high up (to offer deeper water resistance) that it's a strain to get it open wide enough to slide my feet in, even without laces in them!  I took a knife and slit it down an extra inch so they slip on with about the same force as other boots I've owned.Third catch is poor strings.  They're round, look fine at first but the outer jacket separates and creates a little hernia looking bulge where the white inner stuffing pokes out.  Once it got bad enough I took some black sewing thread and stitched around as each new area opened up.  Next time I get new boots that do this I'll just buy new strings instead.I love the tread on these.  It has some bite but not all those tiny cracks and crevices that some boots have which makes them MUCH MUCH easier to clear soil and snow out of.  It's more of a field tread than an urban tread but you don't feel like you're wearing cleats on a hard floor either.  If you're old school you will appreciate the long wearing high density rubber sole, although it is not as high density as what I remember from years ago, it does have some give to it, perhaps more silicone in the compound (I don't know, am not a rubber chemist).Overall I'm left feeling like these are not worth their cost.  Besides the strings I do expect to get good wear out of them but $100 boots should have correct width sizing, you should be able to slide your feet in without altering them,  and they should have premium laces not junky ones.They still get 3 stars for the decent leather and durable, easy to clean tread but once they wear out I'll be replacing them with something else instead.  Then again, I may change my mind by then as they're nowhere near worn out yet.\",\n",

I wore them for ten or twelve years, through college and graduate school as a field biologist and outdoor enthusiast.  I spent a few of those years in Oregon, where I wore these almost every day during the nine month rainy season.  (I use clear wax on the leather uppers periodically to keep them waterproof and to hide the scuffs).  By the time I needed a new pair, the Internet existed and I was able to find and order a replacement.  I have been wearing that second pair for at least another twelve years, and they are ready to be retired (there is no traction left on the soles, and one sole has finally come loose from the boot).  I can't express how happy I am to find this model available here.  My actual size is 9.5W, but I wear moderately thick socks with hiking boots, and I have found that the 10M in this model is perfect for me.

Then on my trip I walked 3-5 miles daily for a week.  I had ZERO break-in problems with them, they were comfortable right out of the box.  I can also attest to their excellent waterproofing as I accidentally had to walk through a 3-inch deep puddle and although my pants around my shoes were soaked, not one drop got into my shoes and my feet stayed warm and dry.

I simply glued it back together with epoxy and a couple of clamps.Update April 1, 2013:Now I have been wearing these shoes for nearly a month. They are extremely comfortable walking shoes. They have good traction in snow and on most surfaces. Nor do they seem to slip much on ice.The only problem was mention above where the rubber sole on one shoe started to come apart. I fixed it with a liberal amount of boat building type epoxy, which has held. No problems with the opposite shoe, and no other problems since.I am a heavy person with large wide feet. These shoes are among the most comfortable shoes that I have had in recent years. The steel toe is extra security for my feet.Update September 4, 2013I wear these shoes every day.

I literally thought I would be running home mid-day to change my shoes but tried it anyway. It worked. They felt tight most of the morning but gradually loosened up. I wear them everday(about a month now) and don't even have to think about the fit. They have great traction and ventilation so no complaints about that. The only issue is the lace eyes.(zoom in if you can) Notice that they resemble webbing material. Since the strings are kind of short that come with the shoes they easily come out of the eye and are tedious to get re-laced. Yeah, yeah I can buy longer laces but regardless, i've already decided that these shoes have a poor design for lacing eyes and I suspect that next issue will be either the eyes will cut the laces or the laces will be cutting the eyes. Granted this is still speculation, but I still expect this will be a problem.  However it shakes out if I manage to get a year out of these I'd say they were worth the money. Normally I buy either Redwings or Wolverines which are generally twice the cost but the look and the price got me to try these out this time.

I also have to be able to work on a ladder, in a lift, or out on ceiling beams / catwalks and the like.  Depending on the project, the hours we work can be grueling - 16+ hr days, several days straight.  So finding the right pair of work boots that are comfortable, lightweight, waterproof, and protect from electrical shock hazard are difficult.  As mentioned in a previous review, there are 3 styles/colors.  Of those three only the \"Brown\" color is waterproof.  You can see (zooming into the photo images) on the boot exterior midway up the ankle there is a \"waterproof membrane\" label embedded in the skin.  I have flat feet so for every pair of shoes/boots I have an arch support insert I use.  Even still, these boots are very comfortable.  They offer excellent traction.  I have worn them while trudging thru snow & ice...my feet stay warm and dry.  I have walked thru puddles as deep as my foot.  So long as the water does not go over your ankle and into the neoprene boot insert, your feet will stay dry.  They provide excellent traction.  They do offer a tight fit.  Even over several months they stay tight. Personally, I like that.  I feel it is because they are waterproof.  The only wish I have is that I could get them in all black...stealth military style.  That would work well for when I am working backstage.',\n",

Just kind of a neoprene piece with a rolled edge.  This causes them to put a bit too much pressure on your achilles tendon, which tends to be irritating and uncomfortable.  Other than that, and a bit of an occasional squeak when walking, they are a decent, comfortable shoe so far.  I have been buying the Timberland PRO Gorge shoes for a few years, and I really like those.  The fit is very similar, but those are Electro-Static Dissapative, and this time I was looking for something with Electrical Hazard Protection.  I think if they addressed the issue in the upper heal area, they would be great shoes.',\n",

I am a professional photographer and I was looking for a steel-toe boot to wear while photographing field sports (primarily American football and soccer).I get on my knees a lot when I shoot and before wearing these my toes would cramp up by the end of a game. I wanted a boot that was firm and rigid to reduce the bend on my toes when kneeling, but I also didn\\'t want them to weight too much because I often run up and down the field to get in position to photograph the next play ...these are perfect for that!The other thing I liked about these is the tongue is sealed all the way up to the last two laces so dirt and rocks don\\'t get down inside the boot. I use to come home with my shoes filled with black rubber bits (used on turf fields), but not anymore!The Timberland PRO \"24/7 Comfort Suspension\" comfort system makes these boots the most comfortable I\\'ve ever worn, plus the traction on any surface is outstanding! The heat-resistant sole is excellent when shooting on hot days (especially on hot fields). I shot five games back to back (over a 12-hour period) in 110 degree heat at a 6-man football tournament last August ...my feet didn\\'t sweat at all and while the rest of my body ached, my feet felt fine at the end of that long hot day.So far the only negative thing I can say is after 3 months there was some thread coming loose on the material in the breathing areas on the side of the boots.

The sidewall near the sole on the other shoe blew out.  I haven't had any of those kinds of problems with the Ratchet.  The rubberized toe covering over the steel-toe on the Ratchet is still intact and has saved my feet from pallets, etc. being dropped on them numerous times.  The leather body has withstood scrapes and punctures.  Most importantly, the shoe is still comfortable without needing Doctor Scholl's inserts. I went through inserts about every 2-3 months with the Timberland Pro cloth hikers which cost about $15 a pop.  The Ratchet Hiker's still wearing well and still looking good.

They certainly didn't seem bad while I was wearing them, and although of course my feet get hot when I'm walking hard all day, it's easily bearable.The only downside I can think of is that the front of my foot is very wide and even with the generous toe box there can be some slight chafing, so socks with good padding are recommended.I have not yet had much chance to test their waterproof qualities, but I have no doubt they'll do just fine through the winter.

My feet never got wet wearing these. In terms of all things I could use to rate a boot, I liked them...except for the stiching.the stitching on BOTH pairs of my boots gave out, right along the gore-tex outer layer (the area that was not made out of leather), and came undone on both sides of each boot. It was almost unbelievable...... who ever heard of a something like that?that's something you expect from Walmart boots.I fixed the problem with shoe gloop, but still, for the price of these boots you shouldn't have to make a sacrifice like that. This was all under city-conditions, and should never had fallen apart like they did. I would never, ever trust these things on a trail or serious conditions.

Also, a month before I wore them on a more strenuous hike, Mt Lafayette along the Franconia Ridge Walk in the White Mountain Forest - a 9 mile, 11 hour (for me), 3,900 foot climb to an elevation of 5,300 feet - the best hike with the best views ever, boot hikes strongly recommended if in the area. Anyway, these boots, along with hiking socks, kept my feet comfortable with zero complaints.The Timberline Chicorua boots are sturdy, comfortable and waterproof. I had owned a pair of the slightly less expense Timberland White Ledge boots for over 4 years which have identical bottom and I loved them. For my replacement boots I decided to move up to the next model in the line, the Chicorua, because of the slightly taller support around the ankle and the Gore-Tex membrane which makes them more breathable. My first test was a 4 mile mountain hike over rocky terrain and they felt great without any previous break-in period. I have now used them for backcountry hiking up rough terrain in the White Mountains and Acadia National Park on a 10 day trip and my feet never felt better during or after the hike - no complaints at all, these are the best boots I ever owned!!!Tip 1: As soon as you get these boots rub the leather with some mink oil and repeat a few times year. This will keep them waterproof and insure the leather doesn't dry or crack and will extend their useful life. I did this with my last pair of Timberlines and the leather still looks great after over 4 years.Tip 2: For serious hikes do not use cheap cotton socks. Instead either use wool socks in winter or Hiking Socks. Hiking socks, like Thorlo are expensive but well worth it because they not only wick away moisture, which cotton does not, but also provides much better cushioning that reduce shear and impact forces so your feet feel great and minimizes the potential for blisters. The weak link of a good boot is the socks - it took me years to realize this.\",\n",

On the plus side, they still fit really well and are extremely comfortable (I need boots that are a bit larger than standard) but they fall apart like wet tissue paper now.The first pair I bought was in July of 2012. Within only 1 day of normal use the inner cloth lining of the boots started separating from the outer shell! After that started to happen, it made the boots feel very strange when you walked around, kinda tight now that the liner was pushing up against your foot. I don't know if this is just a problem with the larger pairs (I use a size 12) or what, but it's definitely not acceptable, especially after only 1 day of regular walking. Needless to say, I returned them a few days later and just thought I had a defective pair.After I returned them I ordered a pair of Timberland's White Ledge boots instead, which fit very nice just like the Chocoruas, but fell apart after only 6 months or so.

My average is 3-6 months per pair. Sketchers used to last me about 9 months, which I thought was terrific. These timberlands have lasted over a year, and I\\'m tickled. Just slightly more than a year, really, because they\\'re quite dead, now. But, for the mileage I put on them, and the pounding they took, I got my money\\'s worth.The metal lace guides, which others have had issues with, have held up for me. I was surprised by that, as I didn\\'t like them at first; the \"speed lacing\" hooks at the top particularly. I figured the laces would slide off too easily, or they\\'d bend/break in short order. Those have held well, and no trace of pulling out.However the rubberized bit was the first to separate, shortly after the one year mark. Right at the sides of the ball of the foot. Where the shoe should bend, not surprsingly, is where it started to separate. Since I find myself in standing water a bit more often than most, that hastened the end of their useful life.I still use these for yard work, when traction is not important (only about 1/16 of inch of tread left...won\\'t pass inspection!), when it\\'s dry. The rubber has completely separated from the toe on both shoes around the toe, so they\\'re water scoops, rather than water proof. Again, I don\\'t fault the boots overly much. I\\'m very, very hard on shoes and boots.Another benefit is the easily removed insoles; I use slide in orthotic insoles, and being able to easily swap \\'em out, wihtout destroying the insoles, is nice.Recommend for anyone needing comfortable, light-ish, waterproof boots not requiring steel toes, or other specific OSHA/safety features.

I loved them for the time I could wear them. However, that was only for four days. Seems in order to save some money (on a 120 dollar shoe this amazed me) Timberland decided to use bent metal eyelets for the shoe strings on the lower half of the shoe rather than a more durable cast eyelets or simple punched eyelets. Note I'm not talking about the hooks on the upper half but the lower portion. After wearing them for four days the eyelet broke at one of the bends. This type of quality fits well for the 50$ or under crowd but the 100$ or higher I just couldn't believe it. Also, note this was the second pair not the first, as the first one came with the eyelet already broken. They were so comfortable that I gave them a second chance. Unless Timberland replaces my eyelets with cast ones I'll be returning these and won't be giving them a third chance. These boots are for those trendy types who want to look like the outdoors type at the clubs but are not for the outdoors.

They vent well so my feet stay dry, and they look great. Tread grip is typical for the type, especially being so new.The one concern I was wary of were the two top lace metal grooves above ankle height. I've had boots that had similar lace grooves, and they were made of thin gauge stamped metal most of the time, and they would end up breaking off after a few months of wear due to metal fatigue and stress. The lace grooves on this boot are of a somewhat heavier gauge and they aren't stamped either.

My employer requires us to wear black shoes/boots as part of our uniform since we are out in the public.  These were the most comfortable boots I have ever worn even the first time I put them on.  The issues I have are 1.) shoelaces.  The laces that came with the boots broke within the first week that I have them.  I replaced these laces with a set I got from a pair of Columbia boots I threw out ten years ago.  Those laces have been used in six pairs of boots now, maybe Timberland and all other boot manufacturers should put more regard in the laces than they do. Laces are a very important factor to me when buying boots.  If they skimp on laces, what else do thbey skimp on 2.) Durability.  I bough these in October 2010.  I have worn them every work day since.  Both boots have developed tears where the cloth and leather are stitched together.  Unfortunately I suffer from diabetic neuropathy so I can no longer wear the boots in this condition.  I would like to see Timberland create a boot with the durability to match it's superior comfort.

They are not construction boots, but still hold up better than anything else that\\'s comfortable.  My only Issue with them is the little metal tabs at the top like to catch either your laces or on ladders and trip you up.  Also, they will let a nail through the sole quicker than kiss my hand, but they\\'re really not made for that kind of work.  My solution for years has been to crimp those tabs closed as soon as they come out of the box since I\\'ve never used them to lace the boots anyway...and to avoid nails.Conclusion: If you\\'re looking for a light hiker: this is it.  Also check out Bone Dry Red Heads from Bass Pro as I got 1300 (literally) miles out of a pair of those (they\\'re not as comfortable, though).  If you\\'re looking for a construction boot, this is an incredibly comfortable, less protective option.Notes:  I\\'ve been through so many because construction that includes contact with concrete, gypsum, mud and other things that harden will wear out any leather boot faster than just walking and water.  They last easily as long as anything else I\\'ve had on the jobsite.Random note: I\\'ve run into maybe five or six people now randomly who will be wearing these.
